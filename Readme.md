# Teacher Verification Registry – Verify Experience On-Chain

## 🧠 Project Description

The **Teacher Verification Registry** is a smart contract built on the Clarity language for the Stacks blockchain. It allows a trusted authority (contract owner) to record and verify the teaching experience of educators directly on-chain. Anyone can then verify if a teacher is officially recognized and see their subject and years of experience.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal is to create a decentralized and transparent verification registry that:

- Reduces fraudulent teaching claims.
- Helps employers, institutions, or ed-tech platforms to trust verified records.
- Empowers teachers with portable, tamper-proof credentials.

## 🔭 Future Scope

- Add support for multiple verifiers (accredited institutions).
- Include revocation or update functionality for records.
- Store endorsements or reviews from peers or schools.
- Integrate with front-end applications for real-time verification.
- Add NFT credentials for teachers with dynamic badges.
